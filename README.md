### **Project**

Hybrid Strategies

A hybrid search strategy is an approach that combines database search and snowballing to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in Software Engineering.

We proposed hybrid search strategies and applied to published SLRs that adopted database searches and snowballing. For this, we used the [Snowballing Tool](https://github.com/JoaoFelipe/snowballing) developed by Joao Felipe Pimentel in Python. Additionally, we developed scripts to simulate the proposed hybrid search strategies. The project [Hybrid Strategies](https://github.com/gems-uff/hybrid-strategies) is available under MIT License and UFF at GitHub. 

You can learn more about the hybrid search strategy through the following paper:
